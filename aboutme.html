        This is where it all started. The time to let everything out.
              Everyone has their own way how they cope with their feelings. 
              I came to a point that i began to acknowledge that what i feel is worth something. 
              That worth can change things, people and so much more.
             Instead of overthinking about everything and keeping it to myself.
             After writing this I realized that words are very powerful that it can change lives.
             I have been writing for over 4 years now and doing voice over for 1 year now.
 
             We all have something deep within us and that needs to be let out.
             To encourage other people.
