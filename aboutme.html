          This is where it all started. The time to let everything out. Everyone
          has their own way how they cope with their feelings. I came to a point
          that i began to acknowledge that what i feel is worth something. That
          worth can change things, people and so much more. Instead of
          overthinking about everything and keeping it to myself. After writing
          this I realized that words are very powerful that it can change lives.
          I have been writing for over 4 years now and doing voice over for 1
          year now. We all have something deep within us and that needs to be
          let out. To encourage other people. This is where it all started. The
          time to let everything out. Everyone has their own way how they cope
          with their feelings. I came to a point that i began to acknowledge
          that what i feel is worth something. That worth can change things,
          people and so much more. Instead of overthinking about everything and
          keeping it to myself.

          Hi I'm Lisa I'm a voice artist by heart and a writer by soul. Besides
          writing I love to spend time with my family, eat and to be more
          knowledgeable about the world. people and cultures. Connecting with
